### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dmitry, I'm a software developer from Kharkiv, Ukraine :ukraine:. 
I'm a JS guy, and 90% of my time work with Angular. I used to work with React, but, it was long time ago ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
Currently, working in [Valor Software](https://valor-software.com/) as a FullStack Developer, and also, as a contributor to [ngx-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap)

âš¡ Some interesting facts about me:
1) Have a :cat:, which looks like A.Hitler (or, C.Chaplin, depends on a person)
2) I'm a beer caps collector (hope, one day I will finish app with my collection, haha) :beer:
3) OSS fan, always ready to tinker with something somewhere
4) Original Apple :apple: hater: I really don't like macOS and iOS, because of bunch of stuff, that always breaks there
5) Like to play some PC/PS4 games. Wanna play with me? Write me on Twitter (you can find  link in my github), or, find me in Telegram, with the same id, as here
6) I really like some Marvel / DC stuff :superhero: :supervillain:
7) Memes lover :trollface:

ðŸ’¬ Feel free ask me about ngx-bootstrap, and I do my best to help you
