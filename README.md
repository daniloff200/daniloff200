### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Dmitry, I'm a software developer from  Ukraine :ukraine:.  Unfortunately, I had to leave my country, and right now I'm searching for a new place to stay.
I'm a JS guy, and 90% of my time work with Angular. I used to work with React, but, it was a long time ago ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„
I'm a huge OSS fan, and used to be a contributor to famous libraries, for example, [ngx-bootstrap](https://github.com/valor-software/ngx-bootstrap)

âš¡ Some interesting facts about me:
1) Have a :cat:, which looks like A.Hitler (or, C.Chaplin, depending on the person)
2) I'm a beer caps collector <del> hope, one day I will finish the app with my collection, haha </del> :beer: 
3) Original Apple :apple: hater: I really don't like macOS and iOS, because of a bunch of stuff, that always breaks there
4) Like to play some PC/PS5 games. Wanna play with me? Write me on Twitter / Linkedin (you can find  a link in my github ), or, find me on Telegram, with the same id, as here
5) I'm a huge fan of  Marvel / DC stuff :superhero: :supervillain:
7) Memes lover :trollface:
